Go to the [Exasol Community Edition download page](https://www.exasol.com/free-signup-community-edition/).

## Key Features

- **Fully functioning Exasol v8 database**: Experience the core functionality of the Exasol database without restrictions on features.
- **Easy and secure installation**: Quickly set up Exasol on your desktop with minimal configuration.
- **Packaged as an Ubuntu OVA file**: Distributed in a convenient virtual machine format that runs seamlessly on VirtualBox or similar hypervisors.
- **Linux GUI environment**: Includes a pre-configured Linux GUI that runs the Exasol database and a SQL editor for seamless interaction.
- **Customizable resource allocation**: Allocate CPU and RAM according to the capabilities of your host system.
- **Getting started worksheets**: A set of pre-configured SQL worksheets to guide you through running your first queries.

## Limitations

- **200 GB RAW data limit**: Designed for testing and smaller-scale use cases, the Community Edition has a data storage limit of 200 GB.
- **Not suitable for production**: Intended for testing, learning, and non-production workloads only.
- **Shared system resources**: Exasol is designed to run on dedicated hardware. Since this is a virtual machine, it shares system resources with other applications, which may cause performance fluctuations, especially when running multiple workloads in parallel.


## Support

- **Community Edition**: This version of Exasol is provided as-is, without official support from Exasol. It is not intended for production use.
- **Exasol software**: The Exasol database engine included in the Community Edition is the same enterprise-grade software supported in production deployments. However, the specific packaging as a Community Edition OVA is not supported.
- **Production use**: For production workloads, please contact Exasol Sales to upgrade to a production-ready database with full support for enterprise environments.

## Requirements

To run the Community Edition, your system must meet the following minimum requirements:

- **Platform**: 64-bit x86 (not compatible with Mac M-series/ARM processors)
- **Disk**: 50GB
- **Processor**: 4 vCPUs (default: 8 vCPUs)
- **Memory**: 8 GB RAM (default: 16 GB RAM)
- **Hypervisor**: VMware Workstation Pro (Windows), VMware Fusion Pro (macOS), Oracle VirtualBox, or a similar virtualization platform

For improved performance, allocate more resources if your host system supports it. The default configuration uses 4 vCPUs and 8 GB RAM for a better experience.

2. The VM will boot up, and it will automatically log in to the system.

If prompted to log in manually, use the following credentials:
- **Username**: `exasol`
- **Password**: `exasol`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Update the Database IP Address

After the VM has fully booted, you **must** run the **Update IPs** desktop application to refresh the IP address of the Exasol database. This ensures that clients can connect using the latest network settings.

#### To update the IP:
1. Open the **Update IPs** application.
2. Wait until the script finishes.
3. Verify the displayed IP and confirm the update in the **DB Status Monitor**.
